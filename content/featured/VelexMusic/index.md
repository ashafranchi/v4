I built a marketing website in React.js for a musician using the headless content management system TakeShape to make it easy for the artist to update their website's content directly. I also automated the triggering of Netlify deployment upon any changes. I wrote my own GraphQL queries to curate content from TakeShape. Last, Gatsby.js helps the responsively-designed website load at a lightning-fast speed.
